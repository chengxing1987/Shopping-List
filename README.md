# Shopping List Application
This is my private application for recording what are needed during shopping.

Currently it is in Chinese Language only, and I will add English in future.

The initial version is so simple that it only contains an Android client and a data file stored on Dropbox.

I am using a .txt file because my family members who do not know markup language can also understand and edit the texts.

The current version is unable to deal with synchronization issues as I believe the current design is unable to handle concurrent operations.

[Update]The new version added three fragments independently for shopping list, purchased items and adding new items.
